In this repository you will find a Wordle Words Game clone project, developed with React.js using Vite.js as a template and made all styles with Tailwind.css. All present code is only for Front-End consuming data from an external API.

# Installation 
Please check the official React+Vite installation guide for all requirements for this project before you start. https://vitejs.dev/guide/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

First, clone the repository on following link:

- [https://github.com/DavidMenjivar486/Wordle_Words.git]

Open a terminal and switch to the repo folder:

- [cd Wordle_Words]

Install all the Front-End dependencies with your package manager(in this case npm)

- [npm install]

Start the local development server:

- [npm run dev]
Now, you can access the server at http://localhost:5173/
